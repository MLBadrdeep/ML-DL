# What is Machine Learning?
In theory, machine learning is a subset of computer science that uses data and algorithms to mimic the way humans learn. You see, computers are not like humans. They can only do what we explicitly program them to do , What makes machine learning unique is that it programs machines to learn as we do. Through machine learning, computers and software can improve using new information. Although machine learning is extremely useful in the modern world, it can’t teach computers to behave as humans do. Your computer can’t learn to dribble with a soccer ball while also learning to play chess. A machine learning algorithm only trains a program to tackle one practical problem at a time. In most cases, this problem is studying, analyzing, and finding patterns in large amounts of data.



Notebooks tested with Python 3.7.x.
